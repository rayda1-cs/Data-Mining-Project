**Data Mining – Multi-Model Classification**

This project explores the performance of different supervised machine learning algorithms on the same dataset. The goal is to compare their effectiveness, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and highlight how preprocessing and model choice affect predictive performance.
***
**Project Overview**

The project applies and compares six classification algorithms:

-  Decision Tree

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Naïve Bayes
***
**Workflow**

**Data Preprocessing**

- Loaded and cleaned the dataset

- Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder

- Scaled numerical variables with StandardScaler

- Split the data into training and testing sets

**Model Training**

- Implemented classifiers with Scikit-learn

- Applied cross-validation for evaluation

- Tracked accuracy across models
  
**Model Evaluation**

- Compared model performance on accuracy

- Visualized decision tree structures

- Analyzed trade-offs between interpretability and performance
  
***
**Results and Insights**

- Decision Tree: easy to interpret but can overfit

- KNN: simple and intuitive but slower on large datasets

- Logistic Regression: good baseline but limited with non-linear data

- Random Forest: high accuracy and robustness but less interpretable

- SVM: effective with high-dimensional data but computationally expensive

- Naïve Bayes: very fast and useful for categorical data but assumes independence of features

***
**Applications**

- Healthcare: predicting diseases or patient outcomes

- Finance: fraud detection and credit scoring

- Retail: customer churn prediction

- Education: forecasting student performance
